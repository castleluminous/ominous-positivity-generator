A simple microsite for displaying ominous positivity quotes.

Why? Uhhhh, good question.

# Contributors

No AI was used in the collection or generation of quotes on my end.

You might see some plugins I tried to use in package.json or whatever. Clearly I did not get them running. This site has like 2 lines of text and a button. I'm so tired.

If there is a quote unique enough to be credited, let me know and I can add the source. If you want to add quotes, feel free to contact me or set up a PR. You're also welcome to fork this project.
