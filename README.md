In progress, because I don't want to code until Shai-Hulud chills out a little. This will be a simple microsite to display ominous positivity quotes.

omnomnom.txt contains the list of quotes.

No AI was used in the collection or generation of quotes on my end.

If there is a quote unique enough to be credited, let me know and I can add the source. If you want to add quotes, feel free to contact me or set up a PR. You're also welcome to fork this project.
